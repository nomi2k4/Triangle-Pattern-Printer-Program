Triangle Pattern Printer Program:

This C++ program was written as part of my learning journey to understand the basics of C++ programming. The program prints a triangle pattern using asterisks (*).

Program Overview:

- Uses nested for loops to generate the triangle pattern
- The outer loop controls the number of rows (5)
- The inner loop controls the number of asterisks printed in each row, decreasing by 1 with each row
- Prints a newline character after each row

Features:

- Nested looping structure using for loops
- Pattern generation based on loop counters
- Clear and informative output

How to Run the Program:

1. Copy the provided C++ code into a .cpp file
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler
3. Run the compiled program:
    - On Linux/macOS: ./triangle_pattern
    - On Windows: triangle_pattern.exe

Learning Objectives:

- Understanding nested looping structures
- Using loop counters to generate patterns
- Working with integer variables and arithmetic operators
- Basic pattern generation and printing logic
